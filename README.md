# Diet-Tracker


Overview
The Diet Tracker is a simple Python program that helps you determine your potential weight change based on your daily caloric intake and exercise. By inputting your calorie consumption for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, along with the calories burned through exercise and your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), the program calculates your daily calorie deficit or surplus. It then predicts how much weight you may lose or gain over a week.

Features
Input daily calorie intake for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Input the number of calories burned through exercise.
Input your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) to personalize the calculation.
Calculate the daily calorie deficit or surplus.
Predict weekly weight changes based on your daily habits.
How to Use
Run the program: Execute the Python script in your terminal or Python environment.

Input your data:

Enter the number of calories consumed for breakfast, lunch, and dinner when prompted.
Enter the number of calories burned through exercise.
Enter your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).
Receive your results: The program will calculate your daily calorie deficit or surplus and multiply it by 7 to give you a weekly estimate of your weight change:

A positive weekly deficit indicates weight loss.
A negative weekly deficit indicates weight gain.
A deficit of zero indicates that your weight will remain the same.
